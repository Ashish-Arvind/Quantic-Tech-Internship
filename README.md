# Quantic Tech Internship ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

This repository contains the work I completed during my internship at **Quantic Tech**, focused on advanced topics in **Computer Vision**, including face recognition, object tracking, and safety gear detection using deep learning.

---------------------------------

### 1. **Face Recognition and Tracking**
- Uses OpenCV, YOLOv8 for real-time face detection, FaceNet for vector embeddings
- Implements object tracking using IoU to maintain identity across frames
- Useful for surveillance and attendance systems

### 2. **Hardhat Detection**
- Detects whether workers are wearing hardhats on construction sites
- Trained using custom YOLOv8 with custom dataset
- Real-time alerts can be integrated for safety compliance

### 3. **Person Detection**
- General-purpose object detection using pretrained YOLOv8 tuned to surrounding environment
- Includes fine-tuning scripts and inference examples

## ðŸ§ª Tech Stack

- Python 3.10
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 (PyTorch)
- ByteTrack
